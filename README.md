# Agnostep Help

There are the `.help` (i.e. Help Bundles) to use with GNUstep **HelpViewer** [^1]

[^1]: To install this app within Agnostep-Desktop, use `AgnostepManager` and select **Util** item.

Namely:
- *GWorkspace User Guide*
- *AGNoStep User Guide*

The screenshots used to illustrate those guides were mostly taken from the Agnostep Desktop project.

## Localization

Until now, you have:
- [English](en) (default)
- [French](en)

## Installation

### GNUstep desktops

In a GNUstep Desktop, you should copy the `.help` bundle into the related app. Help support in GNUstep is a work in progress.

### AGNoStep Desktop
 
The installation will be automated with a new item in `AgnostepManager`.
This should be available soon and evoluate as the GNUstep implementation does.
